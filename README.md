# Diabetic retinopathy - Manual screening vs algorithms
Last few months I've been participating in the ![Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/diabetic-retinopathy-detection).

First of all this was a GREAT competition. I really had the feeling that I was helping to solve a problem that might improve the quality of life for millions of people. For a quick introduction see ![Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetic_retinopathy).
